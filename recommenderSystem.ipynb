    "#### Types of Recommender Systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main classes of recommendation systems\n",
    "\n",
    "* Collaborative filtering systems – Collaborative systems generate recommendations based on crowd-sourced input. They recommend items based on user behavior, and similarities between users. (An example is Google PageRank, which recommends similar web pages based on a web pages’ back links). Collaborative systems often deploy a nearest neighbor method or an item-based collaborative filtering system – a simple system that makes recommendations based on simple regression or a weighted-sum approach. The end goal of collaborative systems is to make recommendations based on customers’ behavior, purchasing patterns, and preferences, as well as product attributes, price ranges, and product categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Content-based filtering systems – Content-based systems generate recommendations based on items and similarities between them. (Pandora uses content-based filtering to make its music recommendations). Content-based systems can deploy methods as simple as averaging, or they can deploy advanced machine learning approaches in the form of Naive Bayes classifiers, clustering algorithms or artificial neural nets.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Hybrid recommendation systems – Hybrid recommendation systems combine both collaborative and content-based approaches. They help improve recommendations that are derived from sparse datasets. (Netflix is a prime example of a hybrid recommender)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is Implicit Factorization Model?\n",
    "* A type of Collaborative filtering\n",
    "* Uses a classic matrix factorization approach, with latent vectors used to represent both users and items. Their dot product gives the predicted score for a user-item pair.\n",
    "* The model is trained through negative sampling: for any known user-item pair, one or more items are randomly sampled to act as negatives (expressing a lack of preference by the user for the sampled item).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Weakness of the model and how can it be improved?\n",
    "* Since we are using Implicit Factorization Model which is a type of Collaborative filtering, our model lacks the advantage of Hybrid recommender system. It can't generate recommendation based on similarities between items. The system can be improved with a Hybrid recommender system that includes both Collaborative and Content-based filtering approach."
